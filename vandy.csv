3188,"He asks her advice about sending kids with autism to college. She says moving away from home can be tough, but ""find friends who share your interests. It could be a robotics club or theater. Some students may need to go more slowly and take five years to do a degree."""
3189,"""Some people on this campus are working on treatments,"" @Nick_Zeppos says. ""How do you react to that?"" Prof. Grandin says the question is determining what's actually abnormal -- but researchers MUST work on sensory issues. Sound sensitivity is the most vital area to research."
3190,"Now we're moving into the interview portion with @Nick_Zeppos, asking his own questions and some from the audience. He asks about her early years, pursuing her profession. ""In the early 70s, being a woman was 10 times harder than the autism,"" she says. Wild applause."
3191,She's talking about the squeezing machine that was a major topic in the HBO movie about her life. Brain imagery showed her fear center is three times larger than normal. Now she takes a low dose of an antidepressant to deal with that.
3192,"Artificial intelligence works the same way her brain does, Prof. Grandin says. (There's a Vanderbilt computer scientist working on this very thing: https://t.co/gFBzwfxcjg)"
3193,"If kids are having a tough time deciding what they want to do, why not give construction or machine work a go, she suggests, showing pictures of her livestock devices. ""Stupid people don’t do this sort of metal work. Let's have some respect for the machine shops that built that."""
3194,"Researchers also need to study specific sensory problems, because those issues are real. She struggled with differentiating words as a child. It takes longer to shift attention from one stimuli to another. Some have problems with images breaking up -- she didn't."
3195,"""It's OK to be eccentric, but you can't be a filthy, dirty slob,"" Dr. Grandin says. A scene in the HBO movie about her life where the boss handed her deodorant actually happened."
3196,She says it's important to identify the unique talents of young children diagnosed with autism and then get them transitioning into work when they're still in college. Give students interesting choices to identify their interests. Set high expectations.
3197,"""I wouldn't want to snap my fingers and not be autistic because I like the way I think,"" Prof. Grandin begins. She says people with autism range from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to people who are unable to dress themselves, so she questions the usefulness of the label."
