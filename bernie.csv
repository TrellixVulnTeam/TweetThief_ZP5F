633,"What 95% of the Democratic caucus wants and more importantly, what the American people want, is TWO pieces of legislation which yes, will not only rebuild our physical infrastructure, but will finally invest in the long-neglected needs of our country's working class. Let's do it."
634,"Now is the time, finally, for Congress to stand up for working families and have the courage to take on the big money interests and wealthy campaign contributors who have so much power over the economic and political life of our country."
635,"When the planet gets hotter, with unprecedented forest fires, drought, floods, extreme weather, and acidification of the oceans, when scientists tell us that we only have a few years to avoid irreparable harm to our planet, should we really continue to ignore this global crisis?"
636,"Should we continue to have 600,000 Americans remain homeless, or should we finally begin building the millions of units of low income and affordable housing that we need?"
637,"Should we, as an aging society, force older and disabled Americans into expensive nursing home care or should we expand home health care and allow them the opportunity to stay in their own homes?"
638,Should we continue being the only major country on earth not to guarantee paid family and medical leave?
639,"Should we continue a situation where many millions of seniors are unable to afford to go to a dentist to get treatment for their rotting teeth, or buy the hearing aids and eye glasses they need — or should we expand Medicare to cover those basic health care needs?"
640,"Should we continue allowing the pharmaceutical industry to charge us, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs?"
641,Should we deny low and moderate income young people the opportunity to get the higher education and job skills they need by making community colleges tuition-free?
642,Should we continue to ignore the dysfunctionality of our child care system which forces millions of working families to spend 20-30% of their limited incomes on childcare and keeps over a million women out of the workforce?
643,Should we end the $300 direct payments to working class parents which have cut childhood poverty in our country by half?
644,"For whatever reason, there are pundits out there who say we should compromise even more and cut back on addressing the long-neglected problems facing working families as well as climate change.

REALLY?

Please tell me where we should cut."
645,"No infrastructure bill should pass without a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill. That is the agreement that was made &amp; that is the agreement that must be kept. Physical infrastructure is important, but the needs of working families &amp; combatting climate change is more important."
646,"Aging in America ought to mean aging with dignity. And right now, aging with dignity is very, very difficult for far too many of our elderly people. Let us realize the original goal and vision of Medicare and expand it to include dental, vision, and hearing care."
647,"18 million people in this country have reported being unable to fill a prescription because they couldn't afford the cost.

Please do not tell me we do not need to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and dramatically lower the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/1ZappyWHPe"
648,"According to recent polls:
- 84% of voters want to expand Medicare to include dental, vision, &amp; hearing
- 73% want Medicare to negotiate RX drug costs
- 68% want the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes

It just so happens that good policy is good politics. Let's get it done."
649,"The ruling class in this country is very, very religious. Their religion is greed. And they are prepared to destroy the planet to make a few more dollars.

The good news is this: if we stand together in solidarity around a progressive agenda for working people, we can win. https://t.co/0nl4R7lTc2"
650,"If we were to judge a nation simply by how many millionaires and billionaires it's got, America would be number one — no question — but a great nation is judged by how well it treats its weakest and most vulnerable. We must fight to become a nation of compassion and solidarity."
651,"Under our reconciliation bill, seniors would pay lower prices for prescriptions while receiving hearing, vision and dental care, AND we lower prescription drug costs for all Americans.

It's insane that we have to fight for these obvious steps. But here we are. And fight we must."
652,"The Republican Party, who added $7.8 TRILLION to the national debt under President Trump, wants you all to believe they are very, VERY serious about the national debt now that we are going to be taxing the wealthy to help the working class of this country."

Today, how many Republicans object to spending trillions to benefit the working class of this country? ALL OF'EM. Pathetic."
657,"In the midst of massive labor shortages in many parts of the country, creating a strong childcare system is truly a no-brainer.

Let's finally make child care affordable in this country.
Let's finally make pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds free.
Let's finally invest in the children."
658,"Adding dental, vision and hearing benefits to Medicare is supported by 84% of the American people.
It is supported by 89% of Democrats.
It is supported by 79% of Republicans.
This is what the American people want.
This is what we must deliver to them."
659,"To my mind, it is a bit embarrassing that our great country is the only major country on the planet not to guarantee paid family and medical leave.

Let us pass the reconciliation bill and finally put an end to that international embarrassment once and for all."
660,"In America, elderly people should not be walking around without teeth in their mouth and not be able to afford to go to a dentist."
661,"Should we tell young people of this country, 'sorry, taking on the crisis of climate change just isn't that important'? 
Should we tell working families, 'sorry, we're not going to make child care affordable'? 

$3.5 trillion IS the compromise. Let's get this done."
662,"Why is it that the people of Canada can purchase a vial of insulin for around $12, while just 2 miles away in Detroit, Americans are charged $98.70?

I'll tell you why — because we are the only major country which does not negotiate drug prices. Those days are coming to an end. https://t.co/TqTSX5FZup"
663,"There are many Americans who have lost faith in their government's ability to pay attention to their needs and their everyday struggle just to get by.

Are we going to prove their disillusionment right? Or are we going to have the guts to invest in them after decades of neglect?"
664,"It is no great secret that in America, it is not the United States Congress that regulates the pharmaceutical industry.

It is the pharmaceutical industry that controls the United States Congress. https://t.co/rgS4xVhEeK"

667,I am a little tired of a system which allows 39 profitable Fortune 500 companies to pay ZERO income taxes from 2018 until 2020. We're going to put an end to that absurdity. We're going to make them pay their fair share.
668,I do not think we should be satisfied with a system that sees 1 out of 4 Americans unable to afford the medications that their doctor prescribes.
669,"Some of the wealthiest people in this country, in a given year, do not pay a nickel in income tax. Does anyone think that is vaguely sane?"
670,"How much is ""too much"" when you're talking about saving the planet?
How much is ""too much"" when you're talking about allowing our seniors to age with dignity?
How much is ""too much"" when you're talking about making child care affordable?
We must get our priorities straight."
671,No one in the United States should have to ration their medicine because they can't afford their prescriptions.
672,"Earlier this year, some Republicans claimed the GOP was now ""the party of the working class."" Now, there is not one Republican willing to stand up to the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the health insurance companies, or to the billionaire class. How pathetic is that?"
673,"The overwhelming majority of Americans want their government to finally stand up FOR THEM.

Not for the drug companies.
Not for the health insurance companies.
Not for the fossil fuel industry.

This is what we are trying to do. It's an enormous fight. We're going to win it."
674,"The pharmaceutical industry right now is spending millions and millions of dollars trying to make sure that YOU continue to pay 10 times more for your prescription drugs than do the people of other major countries.

Does that sound acceptable to you?"
675,"When we pass the reconciliation bill, we will:
- lower RX drug prices 
- provide paid family leave to every worker
- dramatically lower the cost of child care
- finally lead the world in the fight against climate change

We cannot let powerful special interests stand in our way."
676,Whether we are successful in our efforts to deliver a government which works for the working class and not the wealthy few depends upon our ability to stand together. Our power is in our solidarity.
677,"I believe in the radical idea that government should deliver for the interests of the people, not the wealthy elite and corporations."

I've got news for the pharmaceutical industry: your greed is coming to an end. https://t.co/W1mxtaQ4Or"
683,"With our budget reconciliation bill, we are taking on the pharmaceutical industry.
We are taking on the health care industry. 
We are taking on the fossil fuel industry. 
We are taking on the entire ruling class.
If we have the courage to stand up and fight, we can defeat them."
684,It is absurd that we have people in this country who every day must choose between being able to afford the medicines they need to stay alive and being able to afford their groceries. It is no exaggeration to say the greed of the pharmaceutical industry is killing people.
685,"Maybe I am a little bit of a radical, but I happen to think that in the richest country on the face of the planet, people should not have to be cutting their pills in half or rationing their insulin."
686,"97% of Democrats, 80% of Independents and 61% of Republicans want Medicare to negotiate with the pharma companies to lower prescription drug prices. Our opponents are not only dead wrong on this policy, they are also way out of touch with what the American people are demanding."
687,Let me ask you a question. Are you satisfied with a system that allows the pharmaceutical industry to charge you $98 for the same vial of insulin that the Canadian people get for about $12?
688,"For years, the story has gone like this: the pharmaceutical industry spends billions lobbying Congress to do nothing to lower prescription drug prices, they get their way. And so the American people continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world.

Time to end their greed. https://t.co/chVW1FNPKj"
689,The business model of the pharmaceutical industry is fraud. Their greed is literally killing Americans. They have spent billions buying politicians &amp; several of their executives became billionaires during the pandemic. Their days of calling the shots in DC must come to an end.
690,"Trump claimed the day before the recall election that ""it all doesn't matter because the California Election is totally rigged."" That's what demagogues say when they can't win elections and want to undermine democracy."
691,The pharmaceutical industry has spent more than $4.5 billion on lobbying and campaign contributions over the past 20 years. That's why we pay the highest prices on earth for prescription drugs. Enough is enough. Democrats must have the courage to defeat their greed.
692,"A recent poll found 61% of all voters support our legislation to finally meet the needs of the working class.

693,"The pandemic has brought enormous harm into the lives of millions of working people. But for the billionaire class, it has been a windfall, their wealth skyrocketing by $1.8 TRILLION.

697,"YES. We can rebuild our physical infrastructure. 

YES. We can do the reconciliation bill, create millions of good jobs, and finally tell the American people that we are going to stand up for working families. Not just the rich and the powerful. 

We can and we must do both."
698,"What polling tells us is people all over this country understand that now is the time for Congress to address the long-neglected problems facing working families. Now is the time to have the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share.

Can we do this? Absolutely."

709,"We have a choice to make. We can listen to the climate deniers and not worry about the impact of climate change and turn our backs on our kids and grandkids.

Or we can listen to the scientists who tell us that we must act boldly and aggressively to prevent a climate catastrophe."
710,"Now is the time to enact the most consequential legislation for the working class of this country since the days of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal. 

Now is the time for working class solidarity. Now is the time to finally build a government which works for all of us."
711,"Now is the time for legislation which says yes, it is absurd that the United States is the only major country not to guarantee workers some form of paid family and medical leave — we must end that absurdity and guarantee paid leave to workers."
712,"To me, that level of inequality is morally unconscionable. 

Now is the time for legislation that says yes, in the richest country on the face of the planet, seniors must be able to age with dignity — we must expand Medicare to cover hearing aids, dental care, and eyeglasses."
713,"Is it acceptable to you that while 2 people own more wealth than the bottom 40% in this country, half our people live paycheck to paycheck, seniors are unable to hear or to see the world around them, and new moms are guaranteed ZERO paid days to spend with their baby?"
714,"This is what oligarchy is all about. The billionaire class and large corporations are working overtime to defeat the Reconciliation Bill, the most significant legislation for working people since the New Deal. Their greed has no end. This is why we need a political revolution."

Is that the kind of economy any working person ought to be satisfied with?"

739,"Our Budget Reconciliation Bill likely won't get ONE GOP vote — the same Republicans who voted for massive tax breaks for billionaires &amp; voted to throw over 30 million people off the health care they have, will not provide any help to improve life for working families. Pathetic."

1133,"I hope you'll join me, @onefairwage and tipped wage workers from around the country tomorrow night at 8:00 PM ET as we discuss the fight to end starvation wages.

What questions do you have for us when it comes to raising the tipped minimum wage in this country? https://t.co/dE7gR078kl"
1134,"Over the last 23 years, drug companies spent $7.6 billion on lobbyists.

Since 1990, they contributed more than $700 million to candidates.

Now the industry charges us the highest prices in the world for prescriptions.

Congress must summon the courage NOW to take them on."
1135,"I am proud to support the New Deal for CUNY campaign calling on New York state to tax the rich and make CUNY tuition-free for poor and working-class students. 

Together, we will make this a reality at public colleges and universities across America. https://t.co/mQeqkgdSUv"
1136,"Congratulations to nurses in Wisconsin who stood together, demanded the dignity they deserve and won! https://t.co/PU4wsfGecC"
1137,"Space travel is an exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth and create a progressive tax system so that children don't go hungry, people are not homeless and all Americans have healthcare. The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy. https://t.co/CbMWYnPFUx"
1138,"CEO pay growth from 1979-2019: 1,167%
Worker pay growth from 1979-2019: 13.7%

Maybe it's a radical idea, but I think it's time we created an economy that looks out for the working people of this country, and not just the CEOs."
1139,"Every benefit, from the minimum wage to the 5-day work week, was earned when people organized. It’s never easy. But workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama are standing together right now and if they win, it will send a shockwave throughout this country. https://t.co/4JVvXAPHfJ"
1140,"Tens of millions of Americans are out of work. Half our people are living paycheck to paycheck. 

But hey, a handful of billionaires have another $1.3 trillion in wealth, so that's okay, right? WRONG.

Enough is enough. We have got to create an economy that works for all of us."
1141,"Right now, women make up 70% of tipped workers, yet they experience 3x the poverty rate as the rest of the workforce. That is an outrage.

Please join me and @onefairwage next Wednesday at 8 PM ET for a conversation with tipped workers on raising the tipped minimum wage. https://t.co/vtiY0CXlGg"
1142,The average worker in America is now making $32 dollars a week less than he or she made 48 years ago – after adjusting for inflation. That is absurd.
1143,We are in a moment in American history where two guys — Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos — own more wealth than the bottom 40% of people in this country. That level of greed and inequality is not only immoral. It is unsustainable.
1144,"When we talk about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, we must include low-income and affordable housing. Today, 500,000 Americans are homeless, and 18 million spend 50% of their incomes on shelter. We can create millions of jobs building the housing we desperately need."
1145,"What will the $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan mean for you and your family?"
1146,"I happen to think that at the end of the day, to deliver for working people, we have got to end the filibuster. https://t.co/WrsYSd5jXZ"
1147,"I stand with nurses in Madison, Wisconsin who are demanding a safe work environment and paid sick leave. They are on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19.  We must treat them like the heroes they are. https://t.co/fMtNc36Od2"
1148,"Let me be clear, we must have the courage to address the crises facing the American people, even if it means taking on the big money interests. Yes, we are off to a really good start. But we must continue to stand up for the working class. https://t.co/qZIoZYPI5n"
1149,"Shock of shocks! After historic voter turnout, the GOP is trying to restrict who can and cannot vote. Cowardly politicians who can only win elections by suppressing the vote need to get out of politics and find a new job. https://t.co/RPgCx6zcxx"
1150,"The American Rescue Plan is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families passed in many decades, and that is because it begins to address, in rather significant ways, the enormous and unprecedented crises they are facing today. https://t.co/khgC0Ul7uf"
1151,"I say to Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet: what is your problem with Amazon workers organizing for better working conditions and better pay? You are worth $182 BILLION. You cannot continue to have it all when so many are struggling. https://t.co/2Iqglogg2u"
1152,We cannot and will not have a moral society when so few have so much and so many have so little. That is the struggle we are engaged in. We must continue to fight for an economy that works for all of us.
1153,"One year ago, Breonna Taylor was murdered by police officers. It is a disgrace that we are still waiting on justice. The time is long overdue for us to combat systemic racism and a broken criminal justice system."
1154,"The American Rescue Plan more than doubles funding for community health centers, which means that more working families all over this country will be able to walk into a community health center and get the care they need. That will be transformative for so many."
1155,"It’s unfortunate Mr. Bezos won’t join our hearing. While he’s become $78 billion richer during the pandemic, families are struggling to survive, so why is he spending a whole lot of money to stop workers from organizing a union at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama? https://t.co/haeBDYHxaz"
1156,"While Senate Republicans told us we cannot afford to provide $1,400 direct payments to the working class, they had no problem introducing a bill this week to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $1.7 trillion tax break to the billionaire class. Total hypocrisy!"
1157,"The American Rescue Plan will
- send $1,400 direct payments to working class adults &amp; their kids
- cut child poverty in HALF
- boost unemployment payments by $300
That is just some of what's in the bill. What a difference it makes when government is on the side of working people."
1158,"This relief bill is the difference between dignity and despair for millions of America’s working families. And yet, not a single Republican — the so-called 'party of the working class' — voted for it! The Republicans have turned their backs on the needs of working families. https://t.co/K4lzs3sUjw"
1159,The Senate must now take up the #PROAct. The trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won’t be satisfied until they have it all. https://t.co/CST7gM13kS
1160,"The $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan will mean the difference between despair and dignity for millions of people in our country. Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people."
1161,"Interesting. The Republican Party claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, according to a recent Pew poll, 63% of lower-income Republicans support the covid relief bill that we just passed - but not one Republican voted for it. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt."
1162,"To the progressive movement, it is because of your support that we just passed the most significant legislation for working people in decades. Let’s talk about just a few of the policies in it. https://t.co/6q0VFlp2oc"
1163,"Under GOP control, Congress passed $1.9 trillion in tax cuts mainly for billionaires &amp; corporations. 
Now, after one of the highest voter turnouts in history, we passed $1.9 trillion to help working families who are struggling.
Do not let anyone tell you your vote doesn't matter."
1164,"What we did is write and pass a bill to address the crises facing the American people, not the wealthy and large corporations. The result is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit the working class in many years. https://t.co/wP91Qe3Mds"
1165,"The American Rescue Plan addresses a crisis that America has ignored for too long: Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth. Yes, we are finally going to provide real help for the children of America. https://t.co/q7fYDINnmI"
1166,"In 2017, Republicans passed a tax bill that provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% &amp; tried taking healthcare away from 32 million people. On Saturday, Democrats voted to provide 86% of Americans with direct payments &amp; cash benefits to 93% of kids. Elections have consequences."
1167,Right-wing Republicans in CA are trying to recall @GavinNewsom for the crime of telling people to wear masks and for listening to scientists during COVID. Extremist Republicans have done enough to undermine democracy already. We must all unite to oppose the recall in California.
1168,"Today, 56 years on from Bloody Sunday, it is absurd that we are still fighting for the right to vote. Not only is it our duty to keep fighting to end voter suppression in all its forms — we must also work to expand our democracy and make it easier for all our people to vote."
1169,The American Rescue Plan is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working people in the modern history of this country. https://t.co/bRcOAqJwKG
1170,Where was Republicans' concern for the deficit when they gave over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations? The bill we are fighting for right now is the most significant piece of legislation for working families that Congress has passed in decades. https://t.co/knwAzjYwOn
1171,"In my mind, the great economic crisis that we face today is half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. And many millions of workers are, frankly, working for starvation wages. Raising the minimum wage is what the American people want, and it's what we have got to do."
1172,There is not one state in our country where you can make ends meet on the current federal minimum wage. Not one! How quickly would Congress raise the minimum wage if they were forced to live on $7.25 an hour? Outrageous.
1173,"There is nowhere — I repeat, NOWHERE — in the United States where a full-time worker being paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 can make ends meet. That is a disgrace. It is far past time that we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give millions of workers a raise."
1174,"Of the 32 MILLION workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour:
- 59% are women
- 31% are Black
- 26% are Latino
This is not just about economic justice — raising the minimum wage would significantly narrow the gender and racial pay gap. Let's do it."
1175,"40 years ago today, I won my first election to become Mayor of Burlington by just 10 votes. 10 votes. Do not ever let anyone convince you of the notion that your vote does not matter. Your vote matters and we need you to stay involved in the political process. https://t.co/KnmVtyvAh0"
1176,"RT @janeosanders: On this day, March 3rd, @BernieSanders won his first Mayoral election by 10 votes. https://t.co/WoWx76nFZL"
1177,I say to the Walton family of Walmart: the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Pay your workers a living wage. https://t.co/fO15Fv08wD
1178,"Why should the taxpayers, many of whom are struggling economically as a result of the pandemic, subsidize the starvation wages being paid at Walmart? The owners of Walmart got $50 BILLION richer during the pandemic. They can afford to pay workers a living wage."
1179,"At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. https://t.co/DftFAaESey"
1180,"Sadly, the Republican Party has turned its back on democracy and evolved into an authoritarian party – suppressing the vote, pushing big lies and conspiracy theories. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend our democratic way of life. We cannot and will not fail them."
1181,"Walmart, the largest employer in America, is owned by the richest family in America. Their wealth has gone up $50 billion during the pandemic, and they spend millions on themselves. But the company they own starts workers off at $11 an hour. That is outrageous. https://t.co/NbKkuZjz5a"
1182,I strongly disagree with the parliamentarian’s ruling about the minimum wage. But the people are demanding an end to starvation wages in America. We will not give up. We must get this done. https://t.co/qt6mYJU7fl

1185,"Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 million workers and would give low-wage workers an extra $3,300 a year.

I'll say that again. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 MILLION workers. Let's get it done."
1186,"The owners of Walmart, the Walton Family, are the richest family in the country. They're worth $200 billion. They currently pay at least HALF their workers less than $15 an hour. That is absurd. The richest family in America can afford to pay their workers a living wage. https://t.co/Yw7bAJBBUp"

1188,"Let me congratulate the workers at Amazon for having the incredible courage to stand up and to fight for a union. The fight you are waging will send a message to workers all across the country that if they stand up, stand together, and fight, they can win. https://t.co/7cG5v6elCb"
1189,"Some people — including Senators — say, ""Well, Bernie, how can we afford to act on climate change?” The real question is: how can we afford NOT to act while climate change causes destruction and suffering? We have a moral obligation to protect the planet for future generations."
1190,"I’m proud to support @gilcedillo’s campaign for reelection to the City Council. He knows that working people built Los Angeles, and he fights every day to make sure their voices are heard over the concerns of the wealthy and the powerful. https://t.co/HsehsIM4zV"
1191,"Cowardly Republicans, afraid of democracy, want to make it harder for people to participate in the political process. What are they afraid of? Our job is to make it easier to vote, increase voter turnout and strengthen our democracy. Together, we will end voter suppression. https://t.co/HVxr7Rldg6"
1192,"No one can tell me that you can live in dignity on $7.25 an hour. It cannot be done. It is time we finally do what is right, and raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. No more starvation wages! https://t.co/0mGwm1TiYH"
1193,I’m endorsing @JuanForRep for state representative because when he gets to the state house he will put the working people of the 19th district before the needs of special interests and the wealthy. https://t.co/jiRoLJfCDo
1194,"This is the height of corporate greed. The owners of Kroger choose to shut down stores instead of simply paying the workers risking their lives who make their corporate profits possible. Absolutely despicable.

https://t.co/oFjbKuuTMM"
1195,When the gap between the very rich &amp; everyone else is widening; when the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our country; when the effective tax rate of billionaires is less than that of average workers; YES. We must address income &amp; wealth inequality.
1196,"Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice – it is about racial justice. Nearly half of Black and Latino workers in America make under $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages, and give 32 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour."
1197,The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that we must end starvation wages in America. That means raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2025. Period. https://t.co/Pxh3QbXNG8
1198,"Let's be clear. The rich are doing just fine. Billionaires are seeing tremendous growth in their wealth. But working families are living in more desperation than at any time since the Great Depression. Congress has got to move forward vigorously, and help the American people. https://t.co/TU6vyW4OVD"
1199,"Instead of spending billions on 30 second tv ads, Democrats must invest in 12 months a year grassroots organizing around the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. If we build a political movement from the ground on up, we cannot lose."
1200,I stand in strong solidarity with fast food workers all over this country who are going on strike today to demand $15 an hour and a union. The Senate must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour with 51 votes this year. We have got to end the crisis of starvation wages in America.
1201,Does the Republican Party believe in democracy or the Big Lie and conspiracy theories? That is what Republicans must decide. That is what is at stake. https://t.co/Mx3M1U4Qaz
1202,"The Covid relief bill when passed is going to do a lot of good for working Americans, but one thing that simply cannot be emphasized enough is that it will cut child poverty IN HALF – the biggest reduction in modern history. That's why we must act and act quickly."
1203,"The impeachment trial was not just about Trump's speech on January 6. It was about whether we remain a democracy or move toward authoritarianism: big lies, racism, divisiveness, violence and one-man rule. That's what the trial was about and that's what 43 Republicans voted for."
1204,"Thank you @USProgressives for your leadership. The Covid Bill in the House increases stimulus checks to $2000 for the working class, raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour, cuts childhood poverty in half and extends unemployment benefits. The Senate must prepare to act quickly."
1205,"It is not acceptable that in America today the very rich get much richer, while working families struggle. No more austerity economics. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. https://t.co/bkMBq5V758"
1206,"It is truly sad and dangerous that only 7 Republicans voted to convict a president who is promoting a Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence, and is aggressively trying to destroy American democracy."
1207,"This is what the Big Lie is all about. Three months after the election, and 61 court decisions later, Trump and his attorneys still refuse to acknowledge that he lost the election. Pathetic."
1208,"This is about greed – plain and simple. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, is a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. I will do all I can to fight it. https://t.co/4FC6E2k0si"

1210,"Maybe – just maybe – instead of listening to the billionaire class we should pass the relief the American people are demanding and desperately need. That’s what Democrats promised, and that’s exactly what we must do. Let's get it done. https://t.co/5o43Jg900S"
1211,It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. https://t.co/BlvQ52unvn
1212,"The Republican Party has a fundamental choice to make. It can be a conservative party that believes in democracy and the rule of law or it can be an authoritarian party that’s built on conspiracy theories, violence and the Big Lie. But it cannot be both."
1213,"While the top hedge fund managers made $23 billion in 2020, millions of people struggled to put food on the table for their children and pay their rent. 

It’s time to rethink our national priorities and finally build an economy that works for all – not just the billionaires. https://t.co/xjWXmjPeOK"
1214,"Congratulations to the House Leadership and the Progressive Caucus. It is absurd to create an income eligibility cap that would mean 40 million Americans who got support under Trump wouldn’t get checks under Biden. Let’s get this done.

1215,"I stand in solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama who are today beginning to vote in a historic union election.

1217,Let's be clear. We will never get 10 votes from Senate Republicans to pass a $15 an hour minimum wage. The ONLY way we can do it now with 51 votes is through the reconciliation process.
1218,"It is absurd that some Democrats think we should tell a worker making $52,000 a year that they are ""too rich"" and cannot get the full $2000 benefit we promised. It makes no sense to me, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people. https://t.co/aksYr44pI7"

1222,"Unbelievable. There are some Dems who want to lower the income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals, and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples. In other words, working class people who got checks from Trump would not get them from Biden. Brilliant!"

1227,The agenda of the budget resolution passed today is not the agenda of wealthy campaign contributors. It is not the agenda of the billionaire class. It is the agenda of the working people of America and with its passage we are closer to restoring their faith in our government.

2249,"It is time for the Senate to act on behalf of the working class who are hurting like they have never hurt before, not the billionaire class who are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good."
2250,We have a choice to make. We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer while everyone else gets poorer and poorer. Or we can tax the winnings a handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans.
2251,"In my view, we can no longer tolerate the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, while over 30 million Americans have lost their jobs and 92 million people are either uninsured or under-insured."
2252,"Yes, by taxing 60% of the wealth gains made by just 467 billionaires during this pandemic, we could guarantee health care as a right for an entire year. And billionaires would still be able to pocket over $310 billion in gains during the worst downturn since the Great Depression."
2253,If we taxed 60% of the windfall gains 467 billionaires made from March 18th until August 3rd we could raise over $420 billion. That’s enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of-pocket health care expenses for everyone in America over the next 12 months.
2254,"At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many our people are hurting, it is morally obscene for billionaires to use a global pandemic as an opportunity to make outrageous profits."
2255,"While millions of Americans are lining up at emergency food banks because they don’t have enough money to put food on the table, Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook has increased his wealth by more than $37 billion during the pandemic and is now worth over $90 billion."
2256,"While 40 million Americans face eviction, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his wealth over the past four months and now has a net worth of more than $70 billion."
2257,"While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the starvation wages at Walmart, our nation’s largest private employer, the Walton family has made over $20 billion during the pandemic and now has a net worth of over $200 billion."
2258,"While Amazon is denying paid sick leave, hazard pay and personal protective equipment to 450,000 of its workers, Jeff Bezos has increased his wealth by over $70 billion."
2259,Let me give you a few examples of the incredible growth in inequality that is taking place during this horrific pandemic.
2260,"In the midst of a president undermining democracy and moving us toward an authoritarian government, in the midst of all of that, we are seeing a massive increase in income and wealth inequality and the movement in this country toward oligarchy."
2261,"In other words, in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an economic meltdown for working families, in the midst of a great struggle regarding systemic racism and police brutality, in the midst of the existential threat of climate change..."
2262,"In all likelihood, in the midst of everything else, we are currently witnessing what is likely the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the modern history of this country."
2263,"Meanwhile, during the last four months, while the very, very rich have become much richer, American households have seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion."
2264,Let me repeat that. 467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $730 billion during the pandemic.
2265,"While over 30 million Americans have seen their $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire, emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to prop up the stock market have meant that 467 billionaires saw their wealth go up by over $730 billion since the pandemic began."
