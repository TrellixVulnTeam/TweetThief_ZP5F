There are no words for how special and powerful of a spirit he was. Hes in my heart today.', 'Find it here: ', 'Are you running/thinking of running in a local election (ex: council race) to help make things better?  I want to help - especially in tackling our housing crisis. We need people running everywhere. Check out our @CouragetoChange endorsement page to learn more.  Good luck! ', 'The suggestion that any job is low skill is a myth perpetuated by wealthy interests to justify inhumane working conditions, little/no healthcare, and low wages.  Plus being a waitress has made me and many others *better* at our jobs than those whove never known that life.', 'Happy New Year everyone  may we all enjoy a meaningful, healthy, and blessed year to come.', 'The fact that these people are so creepy/weird yet are also the ones responsible for shaping the NEWS HEADLINES we all see in media should be really concerning.   I dont even want to know what knuckle-dragging thoughts these people have all day while covering women in politics', 'Im glad you felt the need to share that with the world.  Dont worry, this is a totally normal thought to have and share as an editor of a right-wing website, and totally doesnt prove my point at all.  I hear if you say it enough times youll actually start to believe it ', 'Its starting to get old ignoring the very obvious, strange, and deranged sexual frustrations that underpin the Republican fixation on me, women,&amp; LGBT+ people in general.  These people clearly need therapy, wont do it, and use politics as their outlet instead. Its really weird', 'If Republicans are mad they cant date me they can just say that instead of projecting their sexual frustrations onto my boyfriends feet.  Ya creepy weirdos', 'Id also be happy to share some notes from @GovKathyHochuls work in NY since he seems to be in need of tips!', 'Hasnt Gov. DeSantis been inexplicably missing for like 2 weeks?  If hes around, I would be happy to say hello. His social media team seems to have been posting old photos for weeks.  In the meantime, perhaps I could help with local organizing. Folks are quite receptive here :)', 'Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment, Harry Reid would reach out. It was like he knew.  His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it.  Thank you, Senator Reid. Wishing peace and strength to his family.', '@Corpse_Husband With the sriracha sauce though ', 'Protip: Do not do this ', 'I truly will never adjust to how normal it is in our country to completely dehumanize people once they fall below a certain income.  This is a fmr police commissioner talking about ppl like furniture or animals when his job ostensibly was to protect them too. Telling on himself.', 'Its truly frustrating that Dems &amp; GOP alike water this down into some non-evidence based electoral boogey monster.  Nobody wants to live with these conditions, yet nobody wants to challenge the systems and decisions creating them. Dont complain if you want more of the same $.', 'Also, why should working people be subjected to this?    1. Homeless people often ARE working people, veterans, and/or disabled  2. Why should THESE folks be subjected to unnecessary homelessness in one of the richest cities in the world where 1000s of apartments are vacant?', 'Of course theyre frustrated. Its not policings job or purpose to address housing, provide healthcare or counseling, or solve the reasons people sleep on the subway.  Maybe if we shifted some of that $11B/year spent on robo dogs to housing services we could get somewhere.', '@thefawz @kausartheperson Ummmm this sounds amazing. Chaiquito!', 'Okay, lets see what everybodys got.  Drop the best coquito recipe you know  ', '@WalterTheWhites You should be! Thank you!', '@jeremystamper56 Whatever it takes ', '@dangallo23 Love it', '@sirclinksalot ', 'This is the second time in a few hours Ive heard of daughters being the ones to get their dads to take the shot.  warms my heart', '@NYTWA ', '@KahliefAdams Thank you so much! Were planning to do more on Twitch soon so lets talk ', 'Thank you! Next step: cancellation', 'ADELANTE ', '@mcbyrne @Grace4NY Thanks for tagging - @hannahdreier do you happen to know what area/neighborhood of Queens Mr. Liu is from? Weve worked with FEMA to address this exact issue and have helped many people w/ similar cases find a resolution. Happy to engage or team up with @Grace4NY to help', 'Instead of clickbait with guns in front of Christmas trees, we decided to actually tell you what we accomplished for the community and country this year.   Heres our 21 wins for 2021 ', 'Were back-back-back again!  Despite the challenges, weve accomplished so much together over the past year. Thank you to EVERYONE who zoomed, taught, organized, and built community with us.  Without further ado: 21 wins for 2021. Want to join for 22?   ', 'We can change decisions and conditions. We just did with the idea of sending out millions of free at-home COVID tests - initially laughed at, yet now its happening.  We can do it again. Tens of millions will get relief. Its time for @POTUS to #CancelStudentDebt.', 'Biden needs to lean on his executive authority now. He has been delaying and underutilizing it so far. There is an enormous amount he can do on climate, student debt, immigration, cannabis, health care, and more.  Time is running out - we need to move and use alternative paths.', 'When we suggested this months ago, people were outraged, accused us of insulting peoples character, called us disruptive, etc  Capitol Hill is full of folks who convince themselves theyre 3 steps ahead by rationalizing to themselves why the obvious isnt true. A hustlers dream', 'With BBB delayed, Child Tax Credits will expire and student loans will restart within a matter of weeks. Working families could lose thousands of $/mo just as prices are rising.  That alone is reason for @POTUS to act on student loans ASAP - w/ either moratorium or cancellation.', '@fred_guttenberg @Morning_Joe Thank you Fred and likewise. We all will disagree at some point or another, its healthy and normal when we all have similar goals and different ways to get there. Heres to making more common ground in the future.', 'Yup', 'Felicidades, @gabrielboric! ', 'The fact that Biden has the power to provide student debt relief to millions, had to be forced into extending the eviction moratorium,&amp; has yet to aggressively campaign against the filibuster shows us he has more power than hes using.   Its time to take off the gloves &amp; govern.', '100% agree. The Senate must reconvene immediately and bring BBB to a vote regardless of Manchins statement.   If they forced folks to go on record with BIF, they can force the Senate to go on record with BBB. We can take it up again next year too.  @AyannaPressley is right on.', 'That part ', '@jaytay777 No, thankfully it doesnt have to pass House again next year. House terms are 2 years, so anything the House passed in 2021 can be picked up by the Senate through 22.  When a new House is sworn in after the midterms (Jan 23) is when bills must be reintroduced &amp; voted on again', 'But if that not the case rules-wise, then we arent docked a recon slot but what we  do lose is very precious and critical time to pass one last recon bill before the midterms  Either way,midterms-wise much of that is moot if we dont break filibuster to pass voting rights ASAP', '@ncweaver Even if you could get 10 Republicans, the problem as I explained above is that there is only 1 vote allowed left this year per Senate rules. Its not a political problem, its a procedure/rules problem.', 'Thats also why passing this before the new year was/is so important - delaying could cost us a major item in the Presidents agenda next yr.  Unless we break the filibuster. In that case, it could still cost us a recon slot but at least lets us move on voting rights +other items', 'If we only get 2 recon bills per year, and BBB was supposed to be the 2nd recon of 2021, does pushing roll it over or does the Senate clock restart in 22, BBB is erased as the 2nd 2021 bill, &amp; Dems now only have 2 swings left instead of 3? Likely the latter but not confirmed', 'What makes the choice to push even more harmful (potentially) is that if BBB gets pushed to next year, it raises the question if that decision effectively erases 1 of Bidens 4 chances to pass major legislation before the midterms barring action on filibuster -', 'We, as always, are here to fight for this agenda. What matters most to us is that it gets done. But we cannot just shrug our shoulders and accept this as some Charlie Brown moment.  Our entire democracy is on the line. So we need to get back in there &amp; get this sh*t done. Period', 'People can be mad at Manchin all they want, but we knew he would do this months ago.  Where we need answers from are the leaders who promised a path on BBB if BIF passed: Biden &amp; Dem leaders. *They* chose to move BIF alone instead of w/ BBB, not Manchin.  So they need to fix it.', 'Some of us dont have the luxury of giving up. We serve working, middle class, &amp; poor people. We serve everyday workers getting ripped off &amp; immigrants &amp; Black communities &amp; queer kids needing shelter. We will not walk away from them. And leadership cant walk from them either.', 'To every member who brought up Manchin, they personally promised they had a solution &amp; BBB would pass.  It is simply not an option for Dem leaders to walk from BBB, voting rights, etc. They must find a way, just as they promised they would when we raised this inevitability', 'Either way, we cannot accept no for an answer. Dem leadership - incl but not limited to the President himself and House Dem leadership - wrote a massive check on their credibility the night of the BIF vote in order to secure the votes they needed, *promising* passage of BBB', 'When a handful of us in the House warned this would happen if Dem leaders gave Manchin everything he wanted 1st by moving BIF before BBB instead of passing together, many ridiculed our position.  Maybe theyll believe us next time. Or maybe people will just keep calling us nave.', 'Ppl rag on Congress salary &amp;its easy to score political points on it, but many dont know it requires paying 2 rents, cant deduct work costs, etc  Result is grand gestures to tout that they/staff arent getting COLA adjustments, but then trading stock to make up for it -worse!', 'Whats worse is that many who engage in these practices publicly tout not approving cost of living or MRA increases in the leg branch as a way of claiming fiscal responsibility, yet compensate by engaging in this highly questionable trading. It incentivizes this bad behavior', 'There is no reason members of Congress should hold and trade individual stock when we write major policy and have access to sensitive information.  There are many ways members can invest w/o creating actual or appeared conflict of interest,like thrift savings plans or index funds', 'Good thing the Parliamentarians guidance here is non binding! Its just guidance.  The Senate can still include a path to citizenship in BBB and call a vote on it, which is why we have called on them to do so.', 'Fact is when Dem leadership is really, truly set on something, they use a huge amount of procedural, political, media, &amp; resource tools to force votes in very powerful ways. They do it all the time.  They did it with BIF, they do it with defense, now they need to do it with BBB.', 'Leadership forces votes all the time.   Bc they know ppl talkabt what theyll support until its vote time  The pressure of voting no+ folks@home seeing IS overwhelming. They even force unnecessary standalone votes like the extra Iron Dome $,which actually belongs in Defense $', 'Fox News analysts already reaping the benefits of banning books, I see', 'Thanks! One funny aspect of this is sometimes a detractor will aggressively approach me in person, expecting me to be whatever media has led them to believe, and has no idea what to do after we start talking &amp;they see how misleading it is. The shock creates space for conversation', '@waltshaub It really is there! And its thanks to the public pressure and people not letting it go', 'Like I said, weirdos', '@unusual_whales @waltshaub Noted potentially why here- basically its been very difficult to get the votes to actually pass it, amendments are one process option. But if we can start with all of it *and* get the votes needed to pass it without needing amendments, then great  ', '@bsdtectr @waltshaub Theres policy, process, &amp; politics. Policy wise youre right,bill should have it from the start. Process/politics wise we may have a hard time getting the votes/mvmt if it starts broad. If we can, great! If not,amdmnt votes could create the necessary public pressure to get it in', '@waltshaub Remember they all can have spousal amendments added/included though!', 'Ted Cruz could never ', 'Change happens one conversation at a time.', '@cosmosbaby @waltshaub We actually pay into our health insurance (which we get off the ACA exchange) and arent allowed to write off any work expenses - which include a required 2nd residence.  A lot of false rumors circulate about Congressional perks but Im happy to clarify what they actually are', '@KristerJohnson I started watching it this week! Its great', '', 'What are some of your favorite books / resources about housing?', 'For real though when you see how the GOP openly embrace and leverage fascist members of their party vs how much some Dems run away and frame their own base mobilizers as just as extreme its not hard to see how that asymmetry/false equivalence has contributed to where we are', 'At least she leads by example. She clearly banned all books from her house years ago', 'Well, since he decided to bring me into this  Did you know that Cullar is an anti-choice Dem in a state where women &amp; LGBTQ+ repro rights are under attack?  This district has only gotten bluer, too. Its 2022. We really dont have to settle for rock bottom. Vote @JCisnerosTX', 'Deep thoughts with Jack Handey over here', 'Immigrant and Latino communities notice this hypocrisy on immigration big time too', '@BKSunset @jennyaction We also got fully funded NYCHA in BBB', 'Its shameful how both parties fight tooth + nail to defend their ability to pump endless public money into militarization.  From tanks in police depts to corrupt military contracts, funding this violence is bipartisan + non-controversial, yet healthcare + housing isnt. Its BS.', '@jennyaction @les3025 We successfully fought for its inclusion in BBB, which is one reason why we insisted it pass with BIF instead of letting it get left behind', '@jennyaction Agreed', 'Texans, are you ready?   Were coming in for a major DOUBLE-RALLY next Saturday, Feb 12th to send @GregCasar + @JCisnerosTX to Congress and support community organizing across the state.  This ones going to be special.

Or parents who rely on CTC. When they improve, maybe process can improve too.  Why should we make the lives of obstructionists easier?', 'Yeah its bad ', '.@CongressmanRaja, @JoeNeguse and I have worked to ban members of Congress from trading individual stock for YEARS.
