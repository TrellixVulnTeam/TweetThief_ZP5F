If he did feel triggered by me using the word lesbian, thats valid & I would understand & not post jokes like this. weve been together for 8 years and I knew he wouldnt give a shit. BUT thats just him- if anyone else was triggered by this joke, Im truly sorryFYI@chaotic_sub and my husband @BKreimendahl thought this joke was hilarious btw. He knows im not a lesbian otherwise we wouldnt be together but also totally gets having that life experience and a kinship with the term, and wouldnt begrudge me getting to speak to it and play with it.@chaotic_sub I dont conceive of myself as a lesbian. Im queer, but I identified as a lez/dyke for many years before that changed so its still embedded in there as part of my identity and history. And honestly I thought it would be a better punch for this joke than queer or bisexual@therealkingwackDebris is a beautiful name for a little girl@ElaniKitten @leah_sampson1 @seynique @MILFWEEED @PallaviGunalan @Elliotwith1T @bb_apes @ngocbbuii @jmurffff @HeavenlyGrandpa @krogerbrandmeg @Brittymigs @fatstevebuscemi @AnnamLaughs @tsunderebunhime @olarvia @NILES100 Love uthe first and only time I opened your fleets was last night while breastfeeding at 4am to see you all naked and just.
