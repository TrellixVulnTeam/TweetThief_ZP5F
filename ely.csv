0,i know a girl who dated Conor Oberst and they decided to get matching seahorse tattoos and he got his and then she was like “um I think I wanna break up actually”
1,i just remembered that when I was 23 someone paid me two beers to scrawl my poetry all over the chalkboard walls of a cafe in bushwick and I was like MAMA IVE MADE IT 😭😭😭💀💀💀
2,@zoewhittall Yes!!!! I am so jealous you haven’t watched it yet
3,"and reader when I tell you I made eye contact with the friend and she looked back at me like “this bitch, right”"
4,@StephBencin Hahahahahahaha
5,eavesdropping at a coffee shop to this girl talking for an HOUR STRAIGHT about how she can’t find a good man and she hasn’t let her friend say even a single WORD. like sweetheart the call is coming from inside the house
6,the most ridiculous part of getting tweets reposted by giant Instagram accounts is people I went to high school with thinking it means I’m famous 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
7,@buildabir Idk! Both?
8,@spacecatazz Lol 10000%
9,@bennick_01 @LtC_Remmick Same!!! Neverending breadsticks ftw
10,i went to Chili’s for my 18th birthday and me and my friends split an awesome blossom and virgin strawberry daiquiri’s and I was like “omg this is just like sex and the city”
11,funniest thing about growing up in the Midwest is until I was 20 I thought Chili’s was a fancy restaurant
12,Also this was in response to me trying to convince her to play outside. like play outside while there still IS an outside ok?!?!?!?!
13,3 year old just told me I was “ruining the planet” and I was like kid. you have no idea 😭😭😭

17,@studio_daddy Also then what would do you do with them
18,@studio_daddy good for you bitch
19,the weirdest thing about picking skin/pulling out hair etc is how we make that cute little pile of our winnings beside us. like what? why do we do that?! serial killer vibes
20,@NiccoloAeed It’s so perfect
21,my kid was struggling to put her shirt on and screamed “this is UNACCEPTABLE!” like a teeny tiny CEO
22,my goal is to be the relatives where you know if u show up empty-handed and looking like shit it’s no big deal
23,nothing slaps harder than a cozy chair with a blanket on your lap. grandma had it right
24,@jennycavallero @ginnyhogan_ !!
25,@danielleweisber I wish!!! Just a magically warm day in cold gloomy Brooklyn
26,when I’m sitting in the sunny back garden of a coffee shop working on a television pilot it’s like…where do I think I am? LoS AnGeLeS?!? https://t.co/UF9FDD3AWO
27,a little bit weird how it’s already April when it’s also still March 2020
28,"I can see that many people are horrified by this, so to offer another perspective I will say I think this demonstrates a kid’s capacity to playfully process frightening circumstances outside of their control! they’re gonna be okay ♥️"
29,ok unfortunately that’s a wrap folks. Time to languish and anguish for approximately seven business hours
30,the way my adhd works is in the morning I have 45 minutes I call “the zone of possibility” and if I don’t frenetically accomplish all the day’s tasks within those 45 minutes sadly that’s a wrap on the whole day
31,followed by this morning’s sequel: count and sort the KN95’s 🥴 https://t.co/kD2QTAAEF7

37,"as a mom, i don’t believe in screen time. i prefer to let my children roam unsupervised through prospect park at dusk as god intended"
38,@WomenScribes I can’t handle this
39,Pls be advised this was in the 90s in the Midwest and calling someone gay was an EXTREMELY BIG DEAL
40,in high school I had a best frenemy and when we got really mad we would call each other gay and storm off scream/crying like I HAAAATE YOUUUUU! then we went to college and ended up being each other’s first girlfriends until we were 24 lol
41,@itsmariannnna OMG I CANNOT WAIT
42,@caitmarielle You look amazing!!!!!!!
43,"something they don’t warn you about parenting is you will watch Frozen 8,000 times and want to die and then one day when your kid is asleep you won’t know what to watch and suddenly a tiny part of you will be like hmm you know what would really hit the spot? FROZEN"
44,"my therapist was like “you’re good and talented and you need to focus on that actual reality” and I was like “ok but what is reality, like REALLY?” and they were like “it’s exactly what I just said.” like damn what an own"

53,"@runcourtrun21 Nothing aggressive- they called me once to ask me to make higher payments and I said “I’m sorry I can’t, would you rather I stop paying completely?” and they said no and that was the end of it"
54,"genuinely, for folks asking: every time I sent them three dollars, it was in response to a monthly bill they’d sent me. after 12 months they just…stopped sending me bills. highly recommend at least giving this slow burn medical debt passive aggression a try!"

56,@bkseventy 👎🏻
57,@SnowJessi 100000000%
58,"my favorite part was about 10 months in I had run out of checks, and I literally sent them three dollars. like three crumpled one dollar bills. Probably pushed them over the edge lol"
59,"@sorrytothevines they just stopped sending me bills! every time I sent three dollars, it was in response to a bill. And then suddenly the bills stopped and I never heard from them again lol"
60,@arthistoryisgay YES! someone had suggested I do that and it totally worked
61,"thinking fondly of when I went to the doctor and they insisted I had a mole removed right then, and then sent me a bill for $1200. I sent them monthly checks of three dollars for a YEAR until they finally gave up on me. big win for the long game 😎"
62,gratuitous sibling appreciation post 💖 https://t.co/yeq7vYvOrX

67,@ginnyhogan_ why would you come for me like this
68,RT @ginnyhogan_: Being a writer is hard because it’s so boring and tedious and futile and you have to spend every moment reminding yourself…
69,in 3rd grade at sleepaway camp my whole bunk had an emergency meeting with the camp director because someone was smearing boogers on the bathroom stalls and i was genuinely like “ewwww that is so digusting!” and two days later i was peeing and suddenly realized it was ME

76,I asked my 3 year old why she was wearing undies on her head she said “because I love it. I thinked up the idea with my MIND.” queen shit

82,@karma2350 HORRIFYING!!!!!
83,also it’s really v weird how obsessed people are with genetics? like if you had kids because you needed a tiny person to look like you at least have the good sense to keep that to yourself?????

85,RT @bessbell: I really want to take my comedy career to the next level but there’s no one I can really see myself jerking off in front of a…
86,and then when they leave we have a chuckle :) good wholesome fun :)
87,i love being a queer/trans couple who passes as cis hetero because people are always saying which of my kids looks like me or looks like my husband and they always genetically get it WRONG
88,when I texted my husband about all the DMs I was receiving from people who also accidentally killed their ducks!!!! Rip Oliver Twisted and all the others ❤️😭 https://t.co/CJXZGdma8W

97,I’ve been with my husband for almost eight years and TODAY I found out at 14 he had a pet duck named Oliver Twisted who cried all night unless he cuddled her in bed until she fell asleep but then one night they cuddled a little too close and my husband woke up and SHE WAS DEAD
98,"just felt sad about how cold it is and told myself “that’s ok, March is always disappointing” and then I remembered that it’s April."

104,@PattyArquette your delivery was pure perfection as well 💖
105,Patricia Arquette in Severance saying “maybe I could bring my own car. that way I can leave if I’m uncomfortable or afraid” was how we should all explain wanting to bring our own cars! a truly perfect truth bomb

109,@ChloeCunha Ugh hope you get well soon!
110,@ChloeCunha Idk I get it!!! Everyone is so tired and wearing a mask all night is so annoying- honestly I think if I was younger and didn’t have two kids I would likely not wear a mask at an open mic either 🤷‍♀️
111,"when i said i wanted to feel 16 again, i didn’t mean being the only masked person at an open mic because I have two little kids at home. major high school dork vibes lol"

123,"i had actually never seen or read HP at the time, I was just a young contrarian bitch but my joker origin story is a couple years later I read the books and LOVED them. now I’m glad I didn’t go though, fuck JK Rowling ❤️"

125,@PallaviGunalan Love this ♥️

979,@carrienewlove I’m truly sorry you’re suffering in this way. I wish you all the best on your fertility journey- it sucks and it’s super hard.
980,"@carrienewlove I’m queer and used IUI, IVF, donated sperm etc so just a reminder too that you don’t always know what people’s journeys to motherhood have entailed, even if they seem easy from the outside. I can imagine having feelings from my content and if it’s helpful just block or mute me!"
981,"@carrienewlove I also don’t think it’s helpful to say “just be grateful,” as though being fortunate in having kids means I lose the right to express the complexity of feelings the come with pregnancy and motherhood. I feel for you in your struggle and wish you the best."
982,"@carrienewlove I’m not body shaming mothers- I’m writing a joke based on my own post-partum experience and ambivalence around the ways pregnancy has changed my body. I actually have an EDO history also, and that is a part of the complexity! For me, it helps to joke about it."
