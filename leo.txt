Full video:.@GuardianUS @CAgovernor @GavinNewsomWater-related catastrophes are a result of the ongoing climate crisis. Having a platform that helps take steps to prevent these events can be an invaluable tool. Im excited to support the innovative work being done at @WeAreWaterplan as an investor.From @CFR_org: The Amazon plays a critical role in climate regulation. Often referred to as 'the lungs of the Earth,' it produces between 6 and 9% of the worlds total oxygen & long functioned as a carbon sink, absorbing more carbon dioxide than it emitted.A new study in the @FrontiersIn journal, reveals forests cool the planet more than experts thought, making the negative impact of deforestation even greater. Via @business:A newly discovered rocket frog from Ecuador already faces an uncertain future. Vote on the species name to stand in solidarity with the communities efforts to #SalvemosIntag.Its time for people to feel good about their purchases and for businesses to meet that challenge. As a Strategic Advisor, I am excited to help supercharge these solutions and begin to reverse the climate emergency.@NPR @UN:@newscientist: Planting trillions of trees wont replace the 10 million hectares of forest ecosystems lost each year, but documenting them could prevent further lossesSince October 2020, @NatGeo has documented a pattern of ReconAfrica breaking rules and ignoring environmental and community concerns in its quest for oil and gas in the #Okavango watershed. Now, it has uncovered even more about the companys activities.Coral scientist @ProfTerryHughes claims a 6th mass bleaching is unfolding across the #GreatBarrierReef. @UNESCOs World Heritage Centre began a monitoring mission to assess if the reef should be added to the World Heritage In Danger list. #SaveOurOceanIts great to see @TheSolutionsProject be recognized for their amazing work toward resolving the climate crisis.Recent @IPCC_CH report tells a sobering truth: Nearly half of humanity is living in the danger zone now. The facts are undeniable. We are living in a climate emergency, and we must take action to protect our planet. #IPCC @UN @antonioguterres.@CityNationals parent company @RBC is violating the rights of indigenous Wet'suwet'en people & bankrolling climate crisis.Join @Gidimten,@Indigenous_ca and 65+ stars to demand they divest from @CoastalGaslink & its source,the tar sands: #NoMoreDirtyBanksToday, our #JustLookUp coalition kicks off at 12:30pm, at Pershing Square in Los Angeles be there to join the movement and march against fossil fuels. @ghostpanther @standearth @ycstrikela @codepinkalert @ExtinctionR @xiuhtezcatl @bankonourfutureWild fish populations are threatened more than ever before.
