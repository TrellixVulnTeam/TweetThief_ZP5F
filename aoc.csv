Either way,midterms-wise much of that is moot if we don’t break filibuster to pass voting rights ASAP"
159,"@ncweaver Even if you could get 10 Republicans, the problem as I explained above is that there is only 1 vote allowed left this year per Senate rules. It’s not a political problem, it’s a procedure/rules problem."
160,"That’s also why passing this before the new year was/is so important - delaying could cost us a major item in the President’s agenda next yr.

Unless we break the filibuster. In that case, it could still cost us a recon slot but at least lets us move on voting rights +other items"
161,"If we only get 2 recon bills per year, and BBB was supposed to be the 2nd recon of 2021, does pushing “roll it over” or does the Senate clock restart in 22, BBB is erased as the 2nd 2021 bill, &amp; Dems now only have 2 swings left instead of 3? Likely the latter but not confirmed"
162,"What makes the choice to push even more harmful (potentially) is that if BBB gets pushed to next year, it raises the question if that decision effectively erases 1 of Biden’s 4 chances to pass major legislation before the midterms barring action on filibuster -"
163,"Many folks bring this up,&amp; it’s not a bad idea. The problem is that due to the filibuster, we can’t vote on items individually.

For the most part, the only major leg Senate can pass w/ 51 votes are reconciliation bills. We only get 2 per year. 1st was Rescue Plan, only 1 left https://t.co/TOg2y22SpX"

Where we need answers from are the leaders who promised a path on BBB if BIF passed: Biden &amp; Dem leaders. *They* chose to move BIF alone instead of w/ BBB, not Manchin.

So they need to fix it."
166,"Some of us don’t have the luxury of giving up. We serve working, middle class, &amp; poor people. We serve everyday workers getting ripped off &amp; immigrants &amp; Black communities &amp; queer kids needing shelter. We will not walk away from them. And leadership can’t walk from them either."
167,"To every member who brought up Manchin, they personally promised they had a solution &amp; BBB would pass.

It is simply not an option for Dem leaders to walk from BBB, voting rights, etc. They must find a way, just as they promised they would when we raised this inevitability"
168,"Either way, we cannot accept no for an answer. Dem leadership - incl but not limited to the President himself and House Dem leadership - wrote a massive check on their credibility the night of the BIF vote in order to secure the votes they needed, *promising* passage of BBB…"
169,"When a handful of us in the House warned this would happen if Dem leaders gave Manchin everything he wanted 1st by moving BIF before BBB instead of passing together, many ridiculed our position.

Knowing constituents are watching &amp; care creates positive pressure to stay strong. When you don’t think your constituents care much, it’s easier to cave."
1325,"The reason it’s helpful to call YOUR rep even when they are doing the right thing is because reps are under a TON of pressure all the time. Sometimes it’s political pressure to change a stance, but sometimes it’s also time pressure vs other leg and you have to choose priorities."
