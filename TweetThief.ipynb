Im grateful for their work and all the people who have been involved in continuing to make the Affordable Care Act everything it can be.', \"Last week, the Biden-Harris administration announced they'd fix a glitch in the regulations that will lower premiums for nearly 1 million people who need it and allow 200,000 more uninsured Americans to get access to health coverage.\", 'Gerda Weissmann Klein was an author, a historian, and an inspiration to so many around the world. As a Holocaust survivor, she shared her story to remind us of the power of hope and the extent of our strength. Michelle and I send our love to her family.', 'The students I met yesterday at Hyde Park Academy in Chicago make me hopeful for the future. Theyre passionate about making a difference, and I enjoyed hearing their stories and sharing a little advice with them.', 'Congratulations to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for her appointment to the Supreme Court. This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history.', 'No trip to Chicago is complete without a @ChicagoBulls game and this time I brought along some of the young people who are part of our @MBK_Alliance and @GirlsAlliance.', \"It's going to take all of us to protect our democracy, especially young people.

Theyve been working hard to improve their communities, and Im looking forward to following their journeys.', 'Always great catching up with @POTUS.

Tune in as I join the @POTUS and @VP to celebrate the Affordable Care Act and talk about how they're taking action to make it better.\", 'Progress often feels slow, and victories are sometimes incomplete. But the ACA shows that if you believe that we can improve peoples lives, and if youre willing to work through obstacles and continually improve, you can make America better.', 'But the ACA was never perfect, and we always knew we would have to make it better. Thats what @POTUS has done since taking office. Today, hes going even further lowering premiums for nearly 1 million people and helping 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage.', 'The ACA also lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors, and allowed young people to stay on their parents plan. And its eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam.', 'Because so many people made sacrifices and some members of Congress took courageous votes, we got the ACA across the finish line. Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions cant be dropped or denied coverage.', 'Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us.
