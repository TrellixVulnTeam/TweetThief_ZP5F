2348,"Moreover, the statements by Strzok raise troubling questions as to whether the FBI was impermissibly unmasking and analyzing intelligence gathered on U.S. persons."
2349,The statements by Mr. Strzok question the entire premise of the FBI‚Äôs investigation of the Trump Campaign and make it even more outrageous that the Mueller team continued this investigation for almost two and a half years.
2350,"Secondly, the comments of Peter Strzok regarding the February 14 New York Times article are devastating in that they are an admission that there was no reliable evidence that anyone from the Trump Campaign was working with Russian Intelligence Agencies in any form."
2351,Those who knew or should have known of this development and continued to pursue a FISA warrant against Mr. Page anyway are in deep legal jeopardy in my view.
2352,The dossier was a critical document to justify a FISA warrant against Mr. Page and this DOJ memo clearly indicates that the reliability of the dossier was completely destroyed after the interview with the primary sub-source in January 2017.
2353,"Most importantly after this interview of the sub-source and the subsequent memo detailing the contents of the interview, it was a miscarriage of justice for the FBI and the Department of Justice to continue to seek a FISA warrant against Carter Page in April and June of 2017."

We CANNOT have 535 Commanders in Chief."

3199,"However, when it comes to commanding the military and directing our forces, we have a single Commander in Chief -- not 535 of them.  

The War Powers Resolution seeks to destroy this balance."
3200,"Thank goodness that our Constitution does not make Congress the Commander in Chief.  

The balance of power in the Constitution regarding military power and war is quite brilliant.  

No single individual ‚Äì including the president ‚Äì can put the nation in a legal state of war."

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Iran must stop being the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stop ballistic missile buildup which jeopardizes regional stability.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Negotiate a nuclear deal which provides nuclear power to Iran while dismantling a pathway to a bomb."

What is necessary is to lay out our strategic objectives regarding Iran in a simple and firm fashion."

3218,"Fortunately for the United States, President @realDonaldTrump has charted a different path than that of President Obama. 
 
The Iranians only understand strength and contrary to what Senator Paul says, now is not the time to get back on the Obama path."
3219,"They are intent on continuing to be the largest state sponsor of terrorism by dismembering the Middle East, destroying the state of Israel, and acquiring a nuclear weapon.
 
Any senator or president who fails to understand this makes a grave mistake."
3220,"The moderate Iranian voices are being shot down in the street for demanding freedom. 
 
There is only one voice when it comes to Iranian foreign policy ‚Äì it is that of the Ayatollah and his henchmen."
3221,"Senator @RandPaul - like the Obama Administration - is under the illusion there are multiple voices making decisions for the Iranian theocracy ‚Äì from moderate to hardliner.  

I would encourage my Senate colleagues to not fall for this Iranian mythology.

3226,"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Dismembering Syria and Yemen.

President Trump is right to demand this regime change its behavior.  

The Democratic Party‚Äôs pathetic response to the killing of Soleimani only emboldens our enemies."
3227,"To my Democratic colleagues:  40 years of Iranian aggression needs to be dealt with forcefully.
 
Iran is:

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The largest state sponsor of terrorism.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Threatening the existence of Israel by arming Hezbollah to the teeth.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Providing arms to kill Americans in Iraq."

He effectively signed his own death warrant by planning massive attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and throughout the Middle East."
3243,"We killed the most powerful man in Tehran short of the Ayatollah.  

This was not an act of revenge for what he had done in the past.
