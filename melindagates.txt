But when women can plan and space their pregnancies, the ripple effects improve outcomes for entire communities.The world became a safer place for women today with the Biden-Harris administrations decision to reverse the Mexico City Policy. This change will make it easier for women to access the reproductive health services they depend on. Make no mistake: Contraceptives save lives.In 2020, global health went local.

If there ever was a president who understands why this issue must be a priority, its President-elect @JoeBiden.

And an even smaller amountless than 0.1% percentwent toward programs specifically targeted at bringing women and girls of color into tech.Take a guess: out of the $500 million these companies spent on philanthropic giving last year, how much went to efforts to increase gender diversity in the industry?Together, we surveyed 32 leading tech companies about their philanthropic and corporate social responsibility initiatives. Our goal was to learn how much theyre investing in gender diversityand whether they could do more.And many tech companies acknowledge that they have a lot to gain by making diversity a priority.

Getting your kids vaccinated is one of the easiest, most effective things you can do to keep them safe.Anemia is common during pregnancy, and new research tells us it doubles the risk of maternal mortality. The good news is that its preventableand by investing in nutrition, we can ensure more moms and babies lead healthy, prosperous lives.Sometimes, life-saving innovation looks like a new drug or a technological breakthrough. And sometimes it looks like this.As @BillGates writes, gene editing could help feed the world, end extreme poverty, and consign diseases like malaria to the history books. Theres a lot left to learn, but the potential is enormousand I cant wait to see the good this technology will do.So inspiring. This is what it sounds like when women refuse to be silenced.By passing a commonsense policy to help working parents, the Senate is setting an important example. Simple changes like this can go a long way toward making our workplaces better for everyone.Malaria has claimed millions of lives and destroyed untold human potential. If we take the right steps now, we can end this disease for good. #MalariaMustDieBetween 2000 and 2015, the world cut the number of malaria deaths in half. Innovations like this make me hopeful well do it again.  #ReadyToBeatMalaria #MalariaMustDie@BrunoLeMaire Thanks for the wonderful conversation, @BrunoLeMaire! Your commitment to increasing Frances development aid is exactly the kind of leadership we need. These funds will fight extreme poverty and improve global health, making the world safer, healthier, and better for everyone..@AminaJMohammed grew up the daughter of a herdsman in Nigeria. Now shes the Deputy Secretary-General of the UN. Heres how shes working to empower women and girls around the world.Thanks for a wonderful discussion, @EmmanuelMacron and @JustinTrudeau. Your leadership on gender equality is critical. Our foundation looks forward to partnering with you during France and Canadas G7 presidencies to ensure these issues remains high on the political agenda.Im inspired to see organizations like @appsandgirls working to close the gender gap in techand giving young women the tools to be innovators, entrepreneurs, and change-makers.This data is deeply disheartening. But Im glad were finally starting to collect itbecause the better we understand the barriers working parents face, the faster we can dismantle them.Amazing news from @reshmasaujani and @GirlsWhoCode. I cant wait to see these girls change the world.Lets continue to demand equal pay for equal work. And lets also go a step further by asking hard questions about what it will take to achieve equal work in the first place.Even in Scandinavian countries known for their family-friendly policies, the gender pay gap persists. This @nytimes piece explores the role that motherhoodand expectations about womens rolesplays.In every country on every continent, women do more cooking, cleaning, and caretaking. On average, women around the world spend 4.5 hours more than men on household chores. This @qz tool helps measure the value of this unpaid, often invisible work.The data geek in me loves this @voxdotcom explainer. It makes a good argument that designing workplaces to be more flexible is the single most important step we can take toward closing the pay gap.This @theeconomist analysis is an excellent deep dive into the issue. It also helps explain why some industries remain dominated by men and others by womenand why jobs in the former category tend to be compensated more generously.To begin to address the pay gap, we must understand what contributes to it, including societal norms around the role of women at home and the value of their labor. Here are some helpful resources about whats causing the gap, and what it will take to close itOn #EqualPayDay, you often hear the rallying cry that women deserve equal pay for equal work. Thats true. But its also only part of the problem. (thread)Human brains are really good at recognizing patterns. If the vast majority of the leaders we see are male, we subconsciously associate leadership with men. The good news is that we can train ourselves to reverse that kind of thinking.From inventing a low-power laptop for children without reliable access to electricity, to developing a low-cost MRI device that could revolutionize healthcare, @mljmljmlj is changing the world, one innovation at a time. #TechMAKERS.@emilychangtv and I had a fascinating conversation at #SXSW. We covered everything from what it was like to be a woman in tech in the 80s to getting more VC dollars into the hands of female founders.Some of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley have teamed up to help more female founders and funders thrive. Their group, @AllRaise, is already making wavesand Im excited to see what comes next.My friend Hans Rosling, who passed away last year, spent his life trying to get more people to understand what he called the secret silent miracle of human progress. You can download a chapter of his extraordinary book here:Thank you, Hans and the Rosling family, for teaching us about our fascinating, surprising, and constantly improving world.The fastest drop in babies per woman in world history was in Iran, home to the largest condom factory in the world during the 1990s.The number of people who die from natural disasters is 25% of what it was 100 years ago. And the population has grown by 5 billion in that span.When I graduated from college, there were 64,000 nuclear warheads on the planet. Now its down to 15,000.When I was 2 years old, 50% of people in the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, its 9%.There is no such thing as a developing world on the one hand and a developed world on the other. Its much more complicated than that, but we naturally think in terms of black and white.The world is better than you think! My late friend Hans Roslings new book, Factfulness, proves it, with his customary flair. It also explains why we tend to think the world is worse than it really is. Here are some of my favorite facts from the book.This video from @StaceySolomon is a heartbreaking, hopeful testament to the way contraceptives change womens livesand their futures..@devi_lo and @RubyAmeliaJ are two women to watch. As co-directors of @FRIDAfund, theyre connecting young leaders with resources to end violence, promote human rights, and build movements for equality. #WomensHistoryMonth (Illustration by @KimothyJoy)When she first came to the U.S., Diana Trujillo worked tirelessly to put herself through college.

I love the name: Making a Difference SistersMAD Sisters for short. #WomensHistoryMonth (Illustration by @KimothyJoy)One of the things that binds our family together is our love of books. @johngreen's latest, Turtles All the Way Down, does exactly that. It struck such a chord with our daughter Phoebe that she decided to write her own review.As @drfeifei says, human values define machine values. Thats why shes working to make sure the machines shaping our future reflect the best of who we are. #WomensHistoryMonth #TechMAKERSImagine having a personal advisor who could tell you exactly what your business needs to grow. Thats what @CarolynRodz created with @HelloAlice: a virtual assistant designed to make entrepreneurship more inclusive and accessible. #WomensHistoryMonth (Illustration by @kimothyjoy)Heres my message for youThanks, @SolarSTEAMGirls and @magssly! Your video made my day.When women in tech returned to work after a pregnancy, about 50% said the experience was great. But 25% rated it closer to horrible. Thats a disappointing outcome for an industry that prides itself on doing the impossibleand we should expect better.Meet Emily Pilloton. As the founder of @projecthdesign and @_GirlsGarage, shes making history by empowering girls to build, engineer, and bring their ideas to lifeand use those skills to lift up their communities. #WomensHistoryMonth (Illustration by @KimothyJoy)In a survey last year, just 3 percent of VCs rated diversity in tech as one of their top concerns. Im hopeful these founders can push that number higherand help create a startup ecosystem thats truly inclusive. #FoundersForChangeTo be successful, every single one of us has to learn new skillsnot just once, but throughout our careers. I talked with @CFair1 about what that means for the future of work..@johncary makes the case better than anyone I know: good design brings dignity to our lives. And we all deserve more of it.I wish @adafruit had been around when I was a kid because this looks like so much fun! Check out how Limor Fried is helping a new generation of engineers create, share, and inspire. #WomensHistoryMonth #TechMAKERSJess Tomlin is an inspiration. Her organization, @MATCHIntFund, is making sure grassroots women's movements get the resources they need to build a better, more equitable future for all of us. #WomensHistoryMonth (Illustration by @KimothyJoy)Its not just a pipeline problem, and its not just a culture problem. There are so many barriers keeping women and minorities out of techand this new report from @kaporcenter and @TheRealFreada is an important step toward breaking them down.New technologies, new business models, and new social movements are redefining work. At #SXSW, I talked with three innovators about how we can harness these changes for goodand create the first workplace in history that truly works for everyone.My philosophy on managing people is that they are people. Theyre not employees. Theyre humans, and humans have all kinds of things that go on. Entrepreneur @nancylublin on shaping the culture at @CrisisTextLine.In global health, gender equity is quite literally a matter of life and death.  Thank you, @SteveDavisPATH, for this essential piece.Im thrilled to partner with @MAKERSwomen on the launch of #TechMAKERS.

As a visionary leader in tech, shes also shaping our future. Heres why I find her so inspiringand why I hope well see more CEOs like her. (via @Refinery29)So excited to watch this! A Wrinkle in Time was one of my favorite books growing up, and I cant wait to see it brought to life by this group of incredible women.Throughout history, so many stories about womens lives and contributions have gone untold. This #IWD2018, the @nytimes is starting to correct that.On International Womens Day, lets remember: When women and girls are equal, everyone is greater. #IWD2018 #EqualisGreaterOut of the headlines and far from the spotlight, millions of women in developing countries are proving the transformative power of self-health groups. Heres why the @gatesfoundation is standing behind them.This #WomensHistoryMonth, Im celebrating the women who are making history before our eyeslike Subarna Ghosh. Subarna saw private-sector hospitals taking advantage of women at one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. Heres what she did next.When money flows into the hands of women who have the authority to use it, everything changesfor women, their families, and their communities. Thats why the @gatesfoundation is investing $170 million in helping women exercise their economic power..@AdamMGrants new @TEDTalks podcast, #WorkLife, tackles a lot of issues that have been on my mind lately about how we can make our work lives work better..@edyong209 calls collecting data on gender bias a vaccine against self-delusion. Hes exactly right, and Im hopeful well see more people and organizations following his lead.I saw Black Panther with Bill and our son, Rory, last weekendand wow. Shuri is one of the many reasons I recommend seeing this incredible, important movie.The most important part of my job at the foundation is listening. Hearing from experts about their work and from women around the world about their lives helps us improve our approachand reminds me why were in this to begin with.After taking on some of the toughest questions weve gotten over the years, Bill and I asked readers to send us their own. Here are our answers.Investing in young people today transforms societies tomorrow. Heres how that happens.Own your accomplishments. Own your ambition. Love this perspective from @RWitherspoon.When we had our first baby, Jenn, I was thankful every day that we lived in a place with access to vaccines, doctors, and reliable care. Every parent and every child deserve those same resources. Thats why were in this work.When Bill and I set out to answer 10 of the hardest questions we get, we hoped it would spark some interesting conversations. We really enjoyed this one with @NickWingfield.The best part of putting puzzles together is seeing the full picture emerge. In global development, that picture is truly beautiful: happy, healthy, productive lives around the world.Is it fair that you have so much influence? Why are you really giving your money away? Bill and I get asked these questions all the time. Theyre toughbut we think theyre worth answering. So, for this years Annual Letter, we did just that.When we launched the foundation, Bill was coming from Microsoft, and I was restarting my career. Heres how we built a partnership of equals.Glamours @SamanthaBarry asked me how Id sum up the past three years of progress for women. Heres what I told herand where I believe we must go next.To say writing our Annual Letter got us out of our comfort zone would be an understatement. But this year, that was kind of the point!  Here are some the hardest questions we've ever been asked.@samanthabarry Thanks for the great conversation, Sam!Im a huge Hamilton fan, so this is a real treat: Bill and I are live for a Q&A with @Lin_Manuel!.@BillGates and I get a lot of questions about our worknot all of them easy. For our 10th Annual Letter, we decided to answer 10 of the toughest.Budgets are a reflection of our priorities. When we cut funding for the programs that are keeping women & children alive, it sends a signal to the world that we do not care about their lives or futures.When I think about whats at stake, I think of Sadi, a woman I met in Nigera mother of six who uses contraceptives because she believes its part of her duty as a parent. It wouldnt be fair for me to have another child, she told me. I cant afford to feed the ones I have.For many around the world, family planning is a matter of life & death. Without the ability to plan & space their pregnancies, women are more likely to die in childbirth, babies are less likely to survive childhood, & more vulnerable families are trapped in a cycle of poverty.While the proposal restores some funding for international family planning, I remain troubled by the impact of underfunding these programs, both through the budget & the continued impact of the Mexico City Policy.For example, the fact that we already had health workers on the ground in Nigeria fighting polio was a key reason we were able to contain the last Ebola epidemic before it reached our shores. Make no mistake: foreign aid funding protects American lives, too.Historically, the U.S. has dedicated only about 1 percent of the federal budget to foreign aid. Even that small investment reaps enormous returnsnot only for the health & well-being of people overseas, but for the safety & security of our citizens.This plan falls far short of Americas longstanding aid commitments, & I think we should be crystal clear about what that means.Today, the President released his budget request for 2019. It continues the misguided approach the Administration has taken toward global health & development over the past year.A great reminder that Black History Month isnt just a chance to celebrate leaders who shaped our past; its a chance to spotlight leaders building a better future. Dont miss the profiles of @SenKamalaHarris, @tamikadmallory, @YrsaDaleyWard, and more.Last year, we started a crucial conversation. Now every one of us can help turn it into action. Here are five ways to get started, from @kaliouby.When @Lin_Manuel agreed to join @billgates and me for a conversation about why we think the world is getting betterwell, lets just say we couldnt throw away our shot. Join us for a live discussion from Hunter College at 12 pm ET Tuesday.For decades, powerful men have responded to sexism in tech by saying, Its always been this way. What they mean is, It will always be this way. @EmilyChangTV's book proves that the first statement is wrong. And we don't have to accept the second.We think of Hans often, and were going to keep doing everything we can ensure his spirit lives on through our work at the foundation.A year ago today, the world lost one of its most passionate evidence-based optimists. Hans Rosling was a true inspiration to Bill and me: his guiding belief was that if people understood how the world was getting better, theyd want to help it get better themselves.In the wake of #MeToo, 3 times as many male managers say they feel uncomfortable mentoring women. But men are an essential part of the solution. Mentorship mattersand it needs to come from both women and men. #MentorHerOn the 100th anniversary of UK women winning the right to vote, Im celebrating the long history of women organizing to make their communities better, safer & fairer for all. Its a story that continues across the world today, led by incredible women like @NimkoAli. #Suffrage100Twenty-five years after its passage, the Family and Medical Leave Act remains the United States first and only law of its kind.

I cant tell you how many times Ive talked with an amazing young coder in the past year and thought: I wish more girls could hear her story.Every day, the link between diverse leadership teams and higher profit margins becomes more undeniable.The darlings of the business world shifted from middle-aged men in Brooks Brothers suits, to college drop-outs in hoodies its about to shift again.  Insightfuland electrifyingpiece from @Refinery29.More and more, companies are realizing that tomorrows top talentdiverse, resourceful, resilientmight not look like yesterdays. And theyre taking action.The vast majority of venture funding happens within a small, homogeneous groupmostly white, mostly male. It means were missing out on all kinds of innovative ideas and economic opportunities. That needs to changewhich is why Im investing in @AspectVC.Its my last day in Kenya, and I was glad to spend it talking with President @UKenyatta about primary care, family planning, maternal and child health, and more.

Lots of progress to celebrateand Im grateful for their dedication to doing even more to empower women and girls.At tonights #MothInKenya event, storytellers from all over Africa spoke about their work to lift up communities and advocate for gender equality. The stories were heartbreaking, hilarious, hopefuland a reminder that our world is full of people working to brighten our future.I believe technology has incredible potentialto cut extreme poverty, make the world more equitable, and improve lives everywhere. Along with Sri Mulyani Indrawati and @StriveMasiyiwa, Im launching Pathways for Prosperitya commission to explore how we can harness tech for good.Since 2015, the number of women in Burkina Faso using contraceptives has risen dramatically. That didnt happen on its own; it happened because leaders chose to make family planning a priority. In doing so, Burkina has proven progress is possible.@rochkaborepf Thank you for your warm hospitality, your leadership, and your continued support of the women and children of Burkina Faso.Madame Bado, on the right in this photo, has three kids. Her oldest was sick the entire time he was a baby. Her younger two had a much healthier start. The reason: she learned a better way to breastfeed. Our partner @aliveandthrive is working to ensure this story repeats itself.Burkina Faso is a small, landlocked country in West Africa with high rates of poverty and mortality. But thanks to strong leadership, its on the cusp of unprecedented growth and opportunity. Im here this week to learn more about how our foundation can support Burkinas rise..@JustinTrudeau I'm honored to be part of the @G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council, and thankful for your continued leadership on this issue.

I have a message for them: its time to quantify the economic costs of sexual harassment. And we need your help to do it.If youre interested in supporting a race or starting your own, @RunningStart and the @CAWP_RU are two great groups that can help you get involved. As inspiring as it's been to see a march grow into a movement, I know its only the beginning.Women have spent the past year campaigning for change, calling out abuse, and reclaiming power. Our country needs more of this. And, to all the women reading this post, it needs more of you in government. #WomensMarch2018After everything shes seen and experienced, @Malala could easily have lost hope. Heres why she made the opposite choice.Already, these women have designed solar-powered robots, broken new ground in medical research, and pioneered exciting new approaches to STEM education. I cant wait to see what they do in 2018.If companies are serious about getting more women in leadership positions, they can start by implementing paid leave policies that support new parents.We celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a day of service because he believed that each of us has the powerand the responsibilityto lift up the lives of others. Lets get to work.I love this approach to instilling good technology habits in your kids: instead of setting new rules for them to follow, work with them to create practical standards for everyone in the familyyourself included.Important piece by @BorisJohnson on why educating girls will change the world. Were proud to partner with #UKAid to increase access to contraceptives. Preventing unplanned pregnancies helps girls stay in school and reach their full potential.Kay was proof of what you can achieve even in the face of so much doubtsome of it coming from yourself! It makes me smile to think of all the young womensome of them at the beginning of their careerswho will see this movie and get to learn from Kays example, too.Our friend Warren Buffett was a friend, business confidant, and champion of Kay's, and I'm eternally grateful that he introduced us. When I first met Kay, I was a young woman just starting my career, and she was an inspiration to me.Kay was a pioneer. When she became CEO of the Washington Post Company in 1972, she was the only woman CEO of a Fortune 500 company. As a leader, she exuded authenticity, strength, and vulnerabilitya mix that made her incredibly effective.Im excited to see @ThePostMovie with my family this weekend. Kay Graham was a dear friend, and I cant wait to see her depicted onscreen.This is one of my favorite @TEDTalks.

Well #TIMESUP. Show your solidarity atMany women in my generation tell our daughters about 1992, the Year of the Woman. Looking back on this year, I bet our daughters will tell theirs about 2017. Heres why.Earlier this year, I asked President @BarackObama about the lessons hes tried to teach his daughters.

Heres one answer.For Bill and me, this was the trip that changed everything.Meet @dafeinberg: a leader at Pixar, a visionary behind @pixarcoco, and a woman whos lighting the way for girls who want to work in techliterally! #ThroughHerEyesWhen I began working in tech, I felt like I had to behave like the guys more aggressive, less collaborative. It made me miserable. So I ran an experiment: instead of trying to fit in, I would try being myself. And suddenly, everything clicked into place.Can algorithms be used to increase the love and kindness in the world? Its a great question, and one I think about a lot. Crisis Text Line might be proof that they can.Its staggering to imagine how much talent weve lost out on due to sexual harassment.

His new book, #PromiseMeDad, is a beautiful tribute. : @dcclphotoThanks to the women who broke their silence, well remember 2017 as the year that we stopped treating discrimination and harassment as the price of admission for women in the workplace. #TIMEPOYEarlier this year, I got to meet some incredible young women pursuing careers in computer science. I had three words of advice for them.  #CSEdWeekThe VC industry could play a major role in driving progress toward a more equal worldbut until it makes diversity a priority, it will continue being a barrier to equality instead. #TechTalksDiversityWhen girls see all the different pathways women take into tech, theyre more likely to find their own. So, this #CSEdWeek, Im calling on my fellow women in computing: Share your story with #ThroughHerEyes.Tech. Media. Hollywood. Women are reaching critical mass in more and more industriesand its changing our society for the better.Just think about how many lives leaders like Chief Mumena and Dr. Kraisintu have saved. We cant let their work be undone. #WorldAIDSDayNearly two decades ago, I lost one of my closest friends. The grief was like a wave crashing down on me. But a circle of friends helped me stay afloat. Sometimes the most important gift you can give someone is simply being there for them. #OptionBThereWomen make up half of the workforce, but only a tiny number of CEOs.
